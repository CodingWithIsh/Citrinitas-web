An unraveling is a slow, profound, and often messy process of deconstruction that must be surrendered to.

The second half of life, prompted by the unraveling, involves a turn inward to seek meaning, purpose, and a connection to the true Self."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This aligns with the work of developmental psychologist Erik Erikson, who identified the central challenge of midlife as Generativity vs. Stagnation.

One cannot achieve true, authentic generativity while operating from a place of \"pretending and performing.\" The ego-driven armor of the first half of life, built for self-protection and external validation, must be deconstructed to make way for the generative self to emerge.
