Mindfulness and cognitive reframing strengthen the prefrontal cortex's ability to manage the brain's fear center (the amygdala). A sense of purpose and optimism shifts the brain from a threat-based state to a more open, approach-oriented one. Therefore, resilience is not just a collection of psychological \"hacks\"; it is the emergent property of a well-regulated nervous system.
